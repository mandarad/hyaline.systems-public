# hi! ⊂(◉‿◉)つ

We are Hyaline* Systems, a tiny creative technology studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark. We specialize in *software and hardware for music, art and audio* ... among other things. 

*_(hy·​a·​line – ˈhī-ə-lən : something (such as the clear atmosphere) that is transparent)_

We say "we" in the above, but actually, mostly, it's just *me*, [Mads Kjeldgaard](https://madskjeldgaard.dk), a sound artist, composer and developer interested in art, music and technology.
