hi! ⊂(◉‿◉)つ

We are Hyaline* Systems, a tiny creative technology studio based in Copenhagen, Denmark. We specialize in *software and hardware for music, art and audio* ... among other things. 

Well, we say *we*, but actually, it's mostly just *me*, [Mads Kjeldgaard](https://madskjeldgaard.dk), a sound artist, composer and developer interested in art, music and technology.
