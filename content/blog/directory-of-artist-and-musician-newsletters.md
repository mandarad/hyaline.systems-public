Newsletters are a great way for artists to send out updates, news, and share thoughts with others, but they suffer from the problem of being scattered across different platforms, making them harder to discover in the same way you would discover others on social media. 

This list should make it easier for you to discover artists, musicians and their newsletters. 

The list is completely open source and you can help make it better (see below)!
